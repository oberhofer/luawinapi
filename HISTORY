  For widestrings within wrapped struct members the user has two Lua functions
    winapi.widestringfromutf8(string or wrapped type)
    winapi.utf8fromwidestring(string or wrapped type)
  which support the string conversion in the two directions.
* genwrap.lua: add skipimpl function definition attribute, which skips 
  generation of wrapper implementation (to allow a user provided impl.)
